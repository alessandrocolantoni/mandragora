 *                        51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 *    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 *  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 *
 *  			    Preamble
 *
 *    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 *  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 *  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
 *  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
 *  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
 *  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
 *  using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
 *  the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
 *  your programs, too.
 *
 *    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 *  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 *  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 *  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 *  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 *  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 *
 *     To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 *  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 *  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
 *  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
 *
 *     For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 *  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
 *  you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 *  source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
 *  rights.
 *
 *     We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
 *  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
 *  distribute and/or modify the software.
 *
 *     Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
 *  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 *  software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
 *  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
 *  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
 *  authors' reputations.
 *
 *     Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 *  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
 *  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
 *  program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
 *  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
 *
 *     The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 *  modification follow.
 *  
 *	                	    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 *       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 *
 *     0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
 *  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
 *  under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
 *  refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
 *  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
 *  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
 *  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
 *  language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
 *  the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 *
 *     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 *  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 *  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
 *  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
 *  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
 *  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
 *
 *     1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
 *  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
 *  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
 *  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
 *  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
 *  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
 *  along with the Program.
 *
 *  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
 *  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 *
 *     2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
 *  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
 *  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 *  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 *
 *        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
 *     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 *
 *        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
 *     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
 *     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
 *     parties under the terms of this License.
 *
 *        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
 *     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
 *     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
 *     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
 *     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
 *     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
 *     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
 *     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
 *     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
 *     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
 *     
 *     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 *  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
 *  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 *  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 *  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 *  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 *  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 *  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 *  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
 *
 *     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 *  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 *  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 *  collective works based on the Program.
 *
 *     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
 *  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
 *  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 *  the scope of this License.
 *
 *      3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
 *  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
 *  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 *
 *        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
 *     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
 *     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
 *
 *        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
 *     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
 *     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
 *     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
 *     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
 *     customarily used for software interchange; or,
 *
 *        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
 *     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
 *     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
 *     received the program in object code or executable form with such
 *     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
 *
 *  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 *  making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
 *  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
 *  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
 *  control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
 *  special exception, the source code distributed need not include
 *  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
 *  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
 *  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
 *  itself accompanies the executable.
 *
 *  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
 *  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
 *  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
 *  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
 *  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 *  
 *     4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
 *  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
 *  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
 *  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
 *  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
 *  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
 *  parties remain in full compliance.
 *
 *    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 *  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 *  distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
 *  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 *  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
 *  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 *  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 *  the Program or works based on it.
 *
 *    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
 *  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 *  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
 *  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 *  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 *  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
 *  this License.
 *
 *    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 *  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 *  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 *  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 *  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 *  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 *  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 *  may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
 *  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
 *  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 *  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 *  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

 *  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
 *  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
 *  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
 *  circumstances.

 *  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 *  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 *  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 *  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
 *  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 *  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 *  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 *  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 *  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 *  impose that choice.

 *  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 *  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 *  
 *    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
 *  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 *  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
 *  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
 *  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
 *  countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
 *  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
 *
 *    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
 *  of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
 *  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 *  address new problems or concerns.
 *
 *  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
 *  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
 *  later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
 *  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
 *  Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
 *  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
 *  Foundation.

 *    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
 *  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
 *  to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
 *  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
 *  make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
 *  vof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
 *  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
 *
 *  			    NO WARRANTY
 *
 *    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
 *  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
 *  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
 *  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
 *  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 *  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
 *  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
 *  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
 *  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 *
 *    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 *  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
 *  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
 *  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
 *  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
 *  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
 *  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
 *  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 *  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 *
 *  		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *  
 *  	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 *    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 *  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 *  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 *
 *    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
 *  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 *  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 *  the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 *
 *      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 *      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 *
 *      This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
 *      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
 *      the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
 *      (at your option) any later version.
 *
 *      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 *      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 *      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
 *      GNU General Public License for more details.
 *
 *      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
 *      along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
 *      Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 *
 *
 *  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 *
 *  If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
 *  when it starts in an interactive mode:
 *
 *      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
 *      Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
 *      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
 *      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
 *
 *  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
 *  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
 *  be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
 *  mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
 *
 *  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 *  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
 *  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
 *
 *    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
 *    `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
 *
 *    <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
 *    Ty Coon, President of Vice

 *  This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
 *  proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
 *  consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
 *  library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
 *  Public License instead of this License.
